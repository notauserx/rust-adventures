Now we’ll add functionality to read the file specified in the file_path argument. First, we need a sample file to test it with:
we’ll use a file with a small amount of text over multiple lines with some repeated words. Listing 12-3 has an Emily Dickinson 
poem that will work well! Create a file called poem.txt at the root level of your project, and enter the poem 
“I’m Nobody! Who are you?”


I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
